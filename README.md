# Discord-multi-tool
I coded this tool months ago and now i completely finished it. In the period i was coding it, i was reading jjk, so i decided to dedicate it to the honoured one, Satoru Gojo, lol.
# Setup
1. Download or clone this repository to your machine, if you're cloning follow these steps:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/0x53616b61692e/Discord-multi-tool.git
```
   Then enter the directory:
```shell
cd Discord-multi-tool
```
   Now follow step 3;
   Finally run the script you're interested in:
```shell
python <code you want to run>
```
2. You need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed 
3. Once you have installed or cloned it, write in Python terminal `pip install -r requirements.txt`, in order to install all the required libraries.
4. Now you can run the script you're interested in.
# About the selfbot
You must compile the `config.json` file or it won't work.
# About the DMspam tool
You must insert your bot tokens in `bot_tokens.txt`. 
Note: the spam won't work if the victim isn't in a discord server with all the bots or if the victim has the dms closed.
# About the RAT tool
You must insert your discord bot token inside the quotes "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN". 
If you want, you can convert the file from py to exe, using libraries like `pyinstaller` or `auto_py_to_exe`
